    question: "How does FundStarter work?",
    answer: "Creators launch projects, set funding goals, and offer rewards. Backers pledge money to help bring projects to life. If the goal is met, backers are charged and creators receive funding.",
  },
  {
    question: "What fees does FundStarter charge?",
    answer: "We charge a 5% platform fee on successfully funded projects, plus payment processing fees (typically 3-5%). There are no upfront costs to launch a project.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if a project doesn't reach its goal?",
    answer: "If a project doesn't reach its funding goal by the deadline, no backers are charged and no money changes hands. The project can be relaunched with adjustments.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to receive funding?",
    answer: "Once your project successfully funds, you'll receive your money within 7-14 business days after the campaign ends, minus our platform fees.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I offer physical or digital rewards?",
    answer: "Yes! You can offer both physical products and digital rewards. Make sure to factor in production and shipping costs when setting your funding goal.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is there a limit to how much I can raise?",
    answer: "No, there's no upper limit. However, we recommend setting realistic goals based on your project scope and audience size.",
